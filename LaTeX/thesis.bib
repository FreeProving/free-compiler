abstract="Functional logic programming languages combine the most important declarative programming paradigms, and attempts to combine these paradigms have a long history. The declarative multi-paradigm language Curry is influenced by recent advances in the foundations and implementation of functional logic languages. The development of Curry is an international initiative intended to provide a common platform for the research, teaching, and application of integrated functional logic languages. This paper surveys the foundations of functional logic programming that are relevant for Curry, the main features of Curry, and extensions and applications of Curry and functional logic programming.",
