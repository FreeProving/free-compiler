   Ãœbersetzung in einen Testfall der obigen Haskellfunktion

   append @a (xs :: [a]) (ys :: [a]) :: b -> [a] = \y -> const
     (case xs of
       []      -> ys
       x : xs' -> x : (append xs' ys ())
     ) y

   Der folgende Test hingegen sollte fehlschlagen. Das okay, da man sowas in
   Haskell nicht schreiben kann.

   append @a (xs :: [a]) (ys :: [a]) :: b -> [a] = \y -> const
     (case xs of
       []      -> ys
       x : xs' -> x : (append xs' ys y)
     ) y
