\section{AST Simplification} \label{sec:implementation:simplification}
In order to make the code that is concerned with the translation to Coq more maintainable and readable, we defined our own simplified data structure for the representation of Haskell modules.
This simplified AST is tailored to our assumptions in \autoref{sec:preliminaries:assumptions} and models only parts of Haskell, that we actually support.

The Haskell AST generated by \texttt{haskell-src-exts} is converted by a component that we call a \textit{simplifier} to our simplified intermediate representation.
The simplifier also checks whether only supported features are used by the input module and rewrites syntactic sugar like infix applications in terms of more basic operations.

The simplified AST is used instead of the \texttt{haskell-src-exts} AST throughout the compiler to analyse the Haskell program and convert it to Coq.
Due to the simplicity of the data structure, all pattern matching performed on the simplified AST can be exhaustive.
If we extend the supported subset of Haskell in the future, the exhaustive nature of the pattern matching will help to find parts of the code that need to be adapted.
