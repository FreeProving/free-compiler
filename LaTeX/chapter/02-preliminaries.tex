\chapter{Preliminaries} \label{chp:preliminaries}
This chapter introduces fundamental concepts that are necessary to comprehend the following chapters.
The first section gives a brief introduction to the Coq Proof Assistant based on the electronic textbook \textit{Software Foundations} by \cite{Pierce:2019} and highlights key differences between Haskell and Coq that need to be addressed by our compiler.
Furthermore, the free monad and how it can be used to model Haskell programs is presented.
Since basic knowledge of Haskell is assumed, no introduction to the Haskell programming language is given.
However, a subset of Haskell, that we will focus on for the remainder of this thesis is presented in the third section of this chapter.
Finally, the notation we are going to employ to describe the translation rules in \autoref{chp:translation} is outlined in the last section.
