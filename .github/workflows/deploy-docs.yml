name: Deploy Haddock Documentation

# The Haddock Documentation is built and deployed on every push to the master
# that modifies Cabal configuration or Haskell source files. It also runs when
# the workflow configuration changed itself.
# When a pull request is closed that makes the same changes, the workflow runs
# as well. We check below whether the pull request was merged. If it was merged,
# the Haddock documentation is built and deployed for the updated master branch.

  # This job deploys the Haddock documentation generated by the `build-docs`
  # job to GitHub pages.

  # This job requires a SSH deploy key for the repository. The following
  # command can be used to generate such a key.
  #
  #     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<email>" -N ""
  #
  #  - The **public key** must be given write access in the repositories deploy
  #    key menu under `Settings > Deploy Keys`.
  #
  #  - The **private key** must be added as a repository secret `DEPLOY_KEY` to
  #    the menu under `Settings > Secrets`.
  #
  # This job will be skipped if the `DEPLOY_KEY` secret is missing.
  # Therefore, it is not necessary to setup deployment to GitHub pages
  # when forking the repository.
  #
  # **NEVER** commit the contents of the private key!
