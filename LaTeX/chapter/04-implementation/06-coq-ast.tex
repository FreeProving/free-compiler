\section{Conversion to Coq} \label{sec:implementation:coq-ast}
For the conversion to Coq, we need a representation of Coq programs in Haskell.
Just like we used an external package for parsing Haskell source code, we are also reusing an existing Coq AST and pretty printer.
The pretty printer is a component for converting the Coq AST to a textual representation.
Unlike \texttt{haskell-src-exts}, there is currently no Coq package on Hackage.
However, the developers of \texttt{hs-to-coq} implemented a Coq AST and pretty printer already.
Thus, we forked their GitHub repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/antalsz/hs-to-coq}} and deleted everything but the Coq language definitions.
We refer to the remaining code in the forked repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/just95/language-coq}} as the \texttt{language-coq} package.
Since \texttt{hs-to-coq} is released under the MIT license agreement, it is possible to publish the package to Hackage in the future.

With our simplified AST and the \texttt{language-coq} package at hand, we can now implement the translation rules from \autoref{chp:translation} very easily.
