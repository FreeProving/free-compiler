\chapter{Translation} \label{chp:translation}
This chapter deals with the specification and explanation of the translation rules that govern the generation of Coq code from Haskell modules.
The translation rules lay the theoretical basis for the implementation of our compiler presented in \autoref{chp:implementation}.
The first two sections cover the translation of type expressions and declarations while the next two sections addresses the translation of expressions and function declarations.
The translation rules are based for the most part on work by \cite{Abel:2005}.
In the final section, an extension to the translation is presented that allows for the generation of templates for Coq theorems from QuickCheck properties.
