\chapter{Implementation} \label{chp:implementation}
In this chapter the actual implementation of the Haskell to Coq compiler is presented.
The implementation is based on the compiler developed by \cite{Jessen:2019} but most components have been completely rewritten by now.
The first section gives an overview of the general architecture of the compiler.
Technologies that have been used for the implementation of the compiler and the phases of the compilation process are summarized.
In sections two through six, the individual phases of the compilation process are described in more detail.
The last two sections address our approach to error handling and how we realize predefined data types and operations.
