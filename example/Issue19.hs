   Ãœbersetzung in einen Testfall der obigen Haskellfunktion

   append @a @b (xs :: [a]) (ys :: [a]) :: b -> [a] = \y -> const
     (case xs of
       []      -> ys
       x : xs' -> x : (append @a @b xs' ys ())
     ) y

   Der folgende Test hingegen sollte fehlschlagen. Das okay, da man sowas in
   Haskell nicht schreiben kann.

   append @a @b (xs :: [a]) (ys :: [a]) :: b -> [a] = \y -> const
     (case xs of
       []      -> ys
       x : xs' -> x : (append @a @b xs' ys y)
     ) y

append @a (xs :: [a]) (ys :: [a]) :: b -> [a] = \y -> const
  (case xs of
    []      -> ys
    x : xs' -> x : (append xs' ys ())
  ) y

append_0 @a !(xs :: [a]) (ys :: [a]) :: b -> [a] = \y -> const
  (case xs of
    []      -> ys
    x : xs' -> x : (append xs' ys ())
  ) y

  (\y -> const
    (xs' >>= \xs_0 -> append_0 @a xs_0 ys) y) ()


append @a (xs :: [a]) (ys :: [a]) :: b -> [a] = \y -> const
  (xs >>= \xs_0 -> append_0 @a xs_0 ys) y
