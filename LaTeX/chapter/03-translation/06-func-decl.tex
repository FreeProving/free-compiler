\section{Translation of Function Declarations} \label{sec:translation:func-decl}
In this final section of the chapter we will cover the translation of the eponymous component for functional programming languages: function declarations.

Just as with type declarations the order of function declarations matters in Coq as well.
Thus, we have to perform a dependency analysis again.
Although the basic principles of the dependency alaysis still apply, adding support for recursive and mutually recursive functions is more involved this time.
This is because Coq strikly distunguishes recursive and non-recursive function declarations.
Therefore, it is not sufficient to simply concatenate generated sentences.
Instead we have to apply a completly different translation scheme to recursive function declarations.
For this reason, we will focus on non-recursive function declarations first.
The translation of recursive functions is covered in the second half of this section.
