\chapter{Translation} \label{chp:translation}

This chapter gives an overview for the translation rules we apply to generate Coq code from Haskell modules.
Because it would be error prone and infeasible to support the full set of Haskell, we start in the first section by specifying a subset of Haskell that we are going to focus on for the rest of this thesis.
The second section gives a brief introduction to the notation we are going to employ to describe the translation rules.
The subsequent sections deal with the formal specification of the actual translation rules.
